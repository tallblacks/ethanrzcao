# ethanrzcao.com

## Project Description
Ethan is my son, and this website is his personal site. I hope Ethan will maintain and upgrade this website himself in the future.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend Framework: Next.JS
- CSS: Tailwind
- UI Components: Material UI
- Cloud Hosting: Vercel
- Database: AWS DynamoDB
- API: AWS API Gateway & AWS Lambda
- Analytics: Google Analytics

## Project Selection

#### Docusaurus
Initially, I considered using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). However, I found that using Docusaurus would complicate things.

I could simply use Next.JS and choose a basic template from Vercel, making minimal modifications.

#### Vercel Blog Starter
I examined two examples on [Vercel Examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/): [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) and [blog](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog).

Both examples convert MarkDown files into web pages. Comparatively, the blog example was too complex for my goals, and the default layout was not as appealing as the blog-starter. Hence, I chose the blog-starter.

#### TimeLine
I wanted a TimeLine feature to record Ethan's milestones, such as flying on a plane, staying in hotels, arriving in new cities, visiting parks and museums, and other life journeys.

At one point, I considered using [React Vertical Timeline](https://stephane-monnot.github.io/react-vertical-timeline/), which looks great but hasn't been updated for years.

So, I decided to use the [Timeline component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-timeline/) from [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/).

#### MongoDB
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) Atlas now offers only 512MB of free storage, which is more than enough for a personal website. However, it's still much less compared to the 25GB free space provided by AWS.  
[Comparison of MongoDB's three paid plans](https://www.mongodb.com/pricing)

#### AWS DynamoDB
[The free 25GB storage](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=categories%23databases) is excellent.  
[The free courses](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/getting-started/?pg=dynamodbt&sec=hs) are nice.  

AWS is highly recognized in New Zealand, which is an important advantage.

I plan to store the TimeLine data in the database. The data includes staying in hotels, flying, attending school or classes, births, and birthdays.  

Although we can organize the data into time, place, people, and events, my intuition leans towards a NoSQL database.
Therefore, I chose AWS DynamoDB for this project.

#### AWS Lambda & AWS API Gateway
When I completed the first version of this site, I took some AWS DynamoDB courses. I completed the 'Amazon DynamoDB Service Introduction,' 'Amazon DynamoDB Service Primer,' and 'Developing with Amazon DynamoDB' courses online.  

I realized that it would be better to use AWS Lambda to access data from DynamoDB. So, I wrote an AWS Lambda function to retrieve the data and used AWS API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function.  

This way, the website only needs to access the API Gateway's HTTP API to get the data. Please refer to the Changelogs for details on July 6, 2024.  

#### Google Analytics
Of course, I use Google Analytics for website traffic analysis.  

Next.js has an experimental feature for [Third Party Libraries](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/third-party-libraries), and [the part about Google Analytics](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/third-party-libraries#google-analytics) is very simple to use.

A table designed to describe the Timeline of Ethan's journey.  
This is currently the only table on ethanrzcao project.

Each item definitely includes the following four parts:  
- **date**  
string  
Most are like "20/10/2021," with a few like "July 2023."

string  
- **description**  
string  
- **timelineOrder**  
number
Specifically designed for sorting purposes, the numeric format is 'YYYYMMDD00', where the last two digits '00' are used to differentiate between different events on the same day.

Additionally, due to issues with my personal computer and my transition to using pnpm, there are other files showing changes related to yarn, which can be ignored since the project is still using yarn.

#### 19 June 2025
###### Migrated the project from Yarn to pnpm
- Check the local project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tallblacks/ethanrzcao.git
cd ethanrzcao
git remote -v
```

- Ensured relevant entries are included in `.gitignore`
```.gitignore
/node_modules
.pnpm-debug.log*
```

- Removed Yarn-related files, including `yarn.lock` and `package-lock.json`
```bash
# Linux or Mac
rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock package-lock.json .turbo .next

# Windows
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules, yarn.lock, package-lock.json, .turbo, .next
```

- Optional: Installed and configured pnpm (skip if already installed)
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm setup

# Reinstalled all dependencies using pnpm
source ~/.bashrc
```

- Applied environment variables
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

- Optional: 
I encountered an issue where `pnpm add` failed. The following steps helped resolve it.
Possible causes: pnpm version issues, leftover project config files, or system path limitations (common on Windows).
In my specific case, it was likely due to an upgrade of the pnpm version.
Solution: delete project-level files generated by pnpm.
```bash
# Windows
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules, .pnpm-store, .modules.yaml, pnpm-lock.yaml, .next, .turbo

# Clean pnpm's global cache (optional, but I did it)
pnpm store prune

# Check global pnpm configuration
pnpm config list

# After a thorough cleanup, reinitialize dependencies
pnpm install
pnpm add XXXX
```

###### Added PDF Support
- Added fileType field in \src\interfaces\post.ts:

- Placed PDF files in both \_posts\ and \public\pdfs\ directories
Since PDFs are displayed directly in the page, a copy must be placed under public.
Note: no auto-copy script has been implemented yet.

- Added YAML files with the same name as the PDFs into the \_posts\ directory to store metadata.

- Added cover images for PDF entries under \public\assets\blog\.

- Updated getPostBySlug and getAllPosts in \src\lib\api.ts
These functions now support reading PDF files from the _posts directory.

- Modified the Post function in \src\app\posts\[slug]\page.tsx
to support displaying PDF files.
Note: when using generateMetadata, make sure to decode params.slug.

- To prevent layout interference when rendering PDFs, 
the returned PDF view in page.tsx uses full-screen fixed positioning:
fixed inset-0: ensures the PDF container covers the entire viewport
z-50: ensures the PDF displays above all other elements
bg-white: provides a clean white background

PDF <object> is absolutely positioned:
absolute inset-0 w-full h-full: ensures the PDF fills the entire container

- Updated getPostBySlug in \src\lib\api.ts
When using a YAML file to describe the metadata of a PDF, TypeScript may not be able to guarantee whether certain properties exist on the metadata object.

Used Partial<Post>: Indicates that the metadata object may only include a subset of the properties defined in the Post type.
Explicit return type: The function signature getPostBySlug(slug: string): Post ensures the returned value always conforms to the Post type.
Safe property access: Used optional chaining like metadata.ogImage?.url to safely access nested properties.
Reasonable default values: Provided default values for all required fields to ensure the returned object always satisfies the Post type.
