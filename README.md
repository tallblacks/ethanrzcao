# ethanrzcao.com

## Project Description
Ethan is my son, and this website is his personal site. I hope Ethan will maintain and upgrade this website himself in the future.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend Framework: Next.JS
- CSS: Tailwind
- UI Components: Material UI
- Cloud Hosting: Vercel
- Database: AWS DynamoDB

## Project Selection

#### Docusaurus
Initially, I considered using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). However, I found that using Docusaurus would complicate things.

I could simply use Next.JS and choose a basic template from Vercel, making minimal modifications.

#### Vercel Blog Starter
I examined two examples on [Vercel Examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/): [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) and [blog](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog).

Both examples convert MarkDown files into web pages. Comparatively, the blog example was too complex for my goals, and the default layout was not as appealing as the blog-starter. Hence, I chose the blog-starter.

#### TimeLine
I wanted a TimeLine feature to record Ethan's milestones, such as flying on a plane, staying in hotels, arriving in new cities, visiting parks and museums, and other life journeys.

At one point, I considered using [React Vertical Timeline](https://stephane-monnot.github.io/react-vertical-timeline/), which looks great but hasn't been updated for years.

So, I decided to use the [Timeline component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-timeline/) from [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/).

#### MongoDB
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) Atlas now offers only 512MB of free storage, which is more than enough for a personal website. However, it's still much less compared to the 25GB free space provided by AWS.  
[Comparison of MongoDB's three paid plans](https://www.mongodb.com/pricing)

#### AWS DynamoDB
[The free 25GB storage](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=categories%23databases) is excellent.  
[The free courses](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/getting-started/?pg=dynamodbt&sec=hs) are nice.  

AWS is highly recognized in New Zealand, which is an important advantage.

I plan to store the TimeLine data in the database. The data includes staying in hotels, flying, attending school or classes, births, and birthdays.  

Although we can organize the data into time, place, people, and events, my intuition leans towards a NoSQL database.
Therefore, I chose AWS DynamoDB for this project.

## Project Development

A table designed to describe the Timeline of Ethan's journey.  
This is currently the only table on ethanrzcao project.

Each item definitely includes the following four parts:  
- **date**
string  
Most are like "20/10/2021," with a few like "July 2023."

string  
Similar to the icon names in the @mui/icons-material/ package, such as Museum, Hotel, etc.
- **event**
string  
- **description**
string  
- **timelineOrder**
number
Specifically designed for sorting purposes, the numeric format is 'YYYYMMDD00', where the last two digits '00' are used to differentiate between different events on the same day.

When the type is Hotel, there will be:  
hotel group, hotel brand, hotel name, hotel city, Hotel country, number of nights
- **type = Museum**
When the type is Museum, there will be:
