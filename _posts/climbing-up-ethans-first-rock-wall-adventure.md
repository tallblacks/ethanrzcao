On June 29, 2025, at 3 years and 8 months old, I had my first-ever rock climbing trial class.

It was my first time ever climbing a wall—and I **LOVED** it!

Ever since that day, I've kept telling Mommy and Daddy:  
"I want to go climbing!"

Now, every Saturday I go to a PE class for kids aged 4 and up.
And every Sunday, I have my private rock climbing class.

Climbing makes me feel strong, brave, and super excited! 🧗‍♂️💪🎉
