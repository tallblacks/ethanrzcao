Hi there! My name is Ethan, and I was born on October 20, 2021, in Auckland, New Zealand. I entered this world around 9:10 in the morning at the North Shore Hospital in Auckland.

Until I was about a year and seven months old, I lived with my parents in Auckland. On the last day of May 2023, I came to Beijing, China, where I met my extended family. My parents say that I'm an Aucklander and a Beijinger.

In July 2023, when I was around 21 months old, I started attending early education programs. I took classes like Montessori Sensorial Activities, music, physical education, art, and crafts, among others.

Before winter arrived in Beijing, I went to Hainan, China, and lived in Sanya and Lingshui for over three months. I loved the ocean, beaches, and splashing in the water.

I returned to Beijing and experienced a traditional Chinese Spring Festival. It was my first time seeing snow, which never happens in Auckland.

In May 2024, when I was two and a half years old, I passed teachers' evaluation and moved up to the big class at the early education center. From Monday to Friday, 8:30 am to 4:30 pm, I'm in early education center with other kids, doing activities, having lessons, eating, napping, and playing.

My third birthday is coming up soon, and I'm excited to start at a preschool in Auckland, New Zealand. I can't wait!

I absolutely love being active and moving around. Running, climbing stairs – it feels like I never get tired! Wherever I am, if I see any playground equipment, I have to play on it over and over again. My parents say other kids learn to walk before they run, but I started running before I was even a year old and never really walked. I'm always trying new ways to move and play. I love balls – whether it's basketball, soccer, or rugby, if it involves a ball, I'm the fastest one chasing after it.

I've stayed in many hotels, and I especially love it. I've been to hotels from groups like Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton, Accor, and InterContinental. When my dad asks me which city I liked best, I say I liked the hotel. When my mom carries me home, I cry because I want to stay at the hotel.

I've visited theme parks like Universal Studios Beijing and Shanghai Disneyland. I adore the rides and never want to get off once I'm on them! I love running on the beach and playing in the sand. I could spend all day in a hotel pool.

I'm fascinated by cars. Before I turned two, I could already recognize most cars on the road. When my parents can't find our car in a parking lot, I tell them where it is. I'm especially good at spotting Teslas and Volvos – I can point out every Tesla we pass. I love all kinds of construction vehicles, police cars, ambulances, fire trucks, and school buses. I enjoy sitting in the driver's seat, playing with the steering wheel, buttons, and touchscreens.

I have a natural talent for electronics. After watching once, I can unlock my dad's phone. Out of dozens of apps, I can find the one that plays my cartoons. I can instantly navigate to kids' shows on airplane or car touchscreens. I can operate all smartphones and tablets after seeing it done just once. But my mom limits my screen time for my eyesight.

I'm really into puzzles. At 21 months old, I could put together puzzles of China's map and the world map. I can take apart and reassemble all the construction vehicles in my fleet using little tools. My mom says I love any toy that makes me think. I can sit quietly and play with Montessori or educational toys for a long time. I also really enjoy books, and I love when my parents read to me. My dad got me the complete Oxford Tree series, and my mom has already read me so many levels and books.

Alright, my friend, if you'd like to get to know me better, feel free to email me. I've had my own email address since I was born, but I can't use it yet. So please email my dad instead.
