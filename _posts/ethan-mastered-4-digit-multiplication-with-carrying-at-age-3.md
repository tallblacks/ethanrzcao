This week, he proudly completed **Lesson 11** of the **16-lesson Grade 2 Montessori Sensory Exploration Course**.

‚ú® He has now **mastered 4-digit multiplication**, including both **carrying** and **non-carrying methods**!

Ethan completed the full **Grade 1 curriculum** back on **March 30, 2025**.  
At this pace, he‚Äôs on track to complete **more than half of Grade 3** by the end of this year.  
By next year, he will have completed **Grade 4**.

Here‚Äôs how Ethan learns:
