Hi! I'm Ethan, and I want to tell you about my amazing parents.

Levin and Mica are my daddy and mommy. They both come from Beijing, China.

My daddy Levin has 30 years of experience in software and website development. In college he studied math and computer.

**Levin and Mica are the proud parents of Ethan. In my eyes, they are the best parents ever!**

We come from a Christian faith background. I'm my mom and dad's only child.

Our family believes in being respectful and kind to everyone. We always try to be honest and fair and follow the rules and morals.

My parents always encourage me to be curious and explore the world. They raise me with lots of love and kindness, teaching me to be strong and good.
